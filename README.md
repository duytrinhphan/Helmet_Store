# Helmet Store

## Introduction
Helmet Store is a web application that allows users to browse and purchase helmets, while also providing an admin interface to manage products, orders, and users. The project was developed as part of the Java programming course at Hutech University from May 2024 to June 2024 and received a grade of 8.5/10.

## Technologies Used
Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate
Frontend: Vue.js
Database: MySQL

# Development Timeline
The project was carried out from May 2024 to June 2024 during coursework at the university.

The source code was uploaded to GitHub in April 2025 in preparation for job applications and to share with potential employers.

## Reason for Late GitHub Upload
Although the project was completed in June 2024, it was not uploaded to GitHub immediately due to a focus on other projects and an internship. The current codebase reflects all work completed during the initial development period.

## How to Run the Project
Install Java 17, Node.js, and MySQL.
Configure the database in application.properties.
Run the backend: mvn spring-boot:run.
Run the frontend: npm run dev.
